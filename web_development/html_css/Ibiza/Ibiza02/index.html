                <p>This second edition of CAN Art Fair in Ibiza, which took place from July 12th to 16th, 2023, signifies the reaffirmation and path toward the consolidation of a project born to propel art in the Balearic island. It serves as a platform to discover the latest in contemporary creation, emphasizing the ever-evolving new artistic languages. Additionally, this year, the fair has expanded, introducing a new OFF Program, featuring three exhibitions of Balearic artists between Ibiza and Formentera, further shaping an Art Week in Ibiza supported by other cultural institutions and promoters.</p>

                <p>&nbsp;</p>

                <p>Over five days, 38 galleries and more than 150 artists attracted over 5,000 visitors from all seven continents, with a notable increase in visits from art professionals.</p>

                <p>&nbsp;</p>

                <p><strong>CCA Andratx</strong> from Mallorca participated by offering an exclusive residency prize awarded to Tariq Oliver (1969 Gallery), the <strong>Fundaci&oacute; Carmen &amp; Llu&iacute;s Bassat</strong> returned for the second year with an acquisition prize for photographer Pixy Liao (L21 Gallery), and the <strong>Lio Malca Collection</strong> also awarded an acquisition prize to Jonny Niesche (The Hole).</p>

                <p>&nbsp;</p>

                <p>For the first time, we were joined by the iconic publishing house Taschen, the NGO Ocean Keepers committed to keeping Ibiza and Formentera beaches free of waste, and Ibiza Global Radio, which broadcasted live and animated the fair each evening with DJ sessions.</p>

                <p>&nbsp;</p>

                <p>We extend our gratitude to all our sponsors for their support and dedication to Contemporary Art. Their contributions have made this edition a unique and extraordinary experience for everyone involved. A special thanks to <strong>Ibiza Trave</strong>l for playing a fundamental role in CAN Art Ibiza&#39;s consolidation. Once again, <strong>Gucci</strong> hosted the fair&#39;s official dinner, <strong>Volkswagen ID. Buzz</strong> became the fair&#39;s official car, transporting our guests. <strong>Alhambra</strong> Beers and <strong>Barcel&oacute; Imperial</strong> continued their support for the fair. With a keen focus on creative expression, <strong>Vilebrequin</strong>, the luxury swimwear brand, returned to Ibiza, this time offering an exclusive sailing experience to Formentera for collectors. The first edition of the OFF Program was made possible by the support of <strong>Paya Hotels</strong>. <strong>Lucas Fox</strong>, a company specializing in residential properties, and <strong>OD Hotels</strong>, as the fair&#39;s official hotel, remained strong allies of the fair.</p>
