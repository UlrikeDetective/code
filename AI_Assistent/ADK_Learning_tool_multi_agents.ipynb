Exit the Palo Alto Caltrain Station and head southwest on University Avenue towards Alma Street.\n2.  Turn right onto Alma Street.\n3.  Turn left onto Cambridge Avenue.\n4.  Turn right onto El Camino Real.\n5.  Turn left onto California Avenue. Jin Sho will be on your right.\n\n**By Public Transit (Bus - Approximately 10-15 minutes, plus walking):**\n\n1.  From the Palo Alto Caltrain Station (Palo Alto Transit Center), take the **VTA Line 21 bus** towards Middlefield & Embarcadero.\n2.  Ride the bus for about 10 minutes until you reach the Middlefield & Embarcadero stop.\n3.  From there, it's a short walk (a few minutes) to Jin Sho on California Avenue.\n\n**By Taxi or Rideshare (Approximately 3-5 minutes):**\n\n1.  You can easily hail a taxi or use a rideshare service from the Palo Alto Caltrain Station.\n2.  The drive to Jin Sho at 454 California Avenue typically takes about 3-5 minutes, depending on traffic."
