Build a Task Manager in Python: Step-by-Step Guide for Beginners

Looking to build an easy, powerful task manager in Python? You are at the right spot! In this tutorial, we will take you step by step through building a functional task manager application using Python and Flask.

This project will guide you through Python web development from setting up your environment right through styling your app interface. Let’s get cracking!

What You’ll Need to Get Started
To kick things off, ensure you have Python installed on your machine. We’ll also be using Flask, a lightweight Python framework ideal for web app development. Here’s what you need:

Python installed (Python 3.x recommended)
Flask library (install with pip install flask)
Project Overview
Our task manager will allow users to:

Add new tasks
Mark tasks as completed
Delete tasks as needed
Let’s jump into creating a structured project and get this app up and running!

What’s Next? Expand Your Task Manager!
Here are a few ideas to level up your task manager:

User Authentication: Enable multiple users to have their own task lists.
Categories and Tags: Let users organize tasks by category for better tracking.
Due Dates and Notifications: Add deadlines for tasks and send alerts when they’re due.
This way, you have created a pretty simple but working task manager in Python using the Flask web application framework.

Such a project will not only perfect your skills in Python but also give a good baseline for other, more complex web development projects.
